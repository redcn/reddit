Congratulations! reddit is now installed.

The reddit application code is managed with upstart, to see what's currently
running, run

    sudo initctl list | grep reddit

Cron jobs start with "reddit-job-" and queue processors start with
"reddit-consumer-". The crons are managed by /etc/cron.d/reddit. You can
initiate a restart of all the consumers by running:

    sudo initctl emit reddit-restart

or target specific ones:

    sudo initctl emit reddit-restart TARGET=scraper_q

See the GitHub wiki for more information on these jobs:

* https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/Cron-jobs
* https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/Services

Now that the core of reddit is installed, you may want to do some additional
steps:

* Add "reddit.local" to your /etc/hosts file as an alias for 127.0.0.1
  (or add it to your host OS's resolver configuration if running in a VM)

* To populate the database with test data, run:

    cd /home/reddit/reddit/r2
    paster run run.ini r2/models/populatedb.py -c 'populate()'

* Manually run reddit-job-update_reddits immediately after populating the db
  or adding your own subreddits.
